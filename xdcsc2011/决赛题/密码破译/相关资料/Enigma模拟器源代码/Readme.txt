 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 This program is an exact simulation of the 3-rotor Army and the
 famous 4-rotor Naval M4 model of the German Enigma cipher machine,
 as they were used during world war II from 1939 until 1945. You can
 select between the two models, choose different rotors or 'Walzen',
 preset the rotor wiring positions or 'Ringstellung' and switch
 letters by using plugs or 'Stecker'.

 The internal wiring of all rotors is identical to those used by
 Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. This simulator is therefore
 fully compatible with the real Enigma crypto machine and you can
 decode original messages and make your own encoded text.

 In the program you can always call the Enigma Help file by Pressing
 F1 or clicking the frame in the top left corner of the simulator.
 This help file contains the manual, how the German military used
 the Enigma, all the technical details and the story of Enigma.

 Special thanks to Tom Perera's Enigma Museum (http://w1tp.com/enigma)
 and Chris Valentine from KMi The Open University for the pictures in
 the gallery, and Frode Weierud for the advice, his help at the
 translation and original messages.
